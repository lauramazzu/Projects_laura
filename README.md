This repository contains a few projects I worked on while going through the challenges of the Angela YU's 100 day of codes bootcamp. 

It is mainly Data Science projects. I worked with the Pandas library from Python to preprocess, clean, analyse and visualise large quantities of data. 

**Methodology**: Python codes, Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Scikit learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, regressions, correlation, N-dimensional arrays.
